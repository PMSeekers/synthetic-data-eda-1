# 🚀 Operations-Driven Data Engineering Portfolio

Welcome! This repository demonstrates my transition from **Amazon Operations** to scalable **Data Engineering** solutions. I build tools inspired by real-world logistical challenges, focusing on synthetic data generation, risk modeling, and audit automation.

## 📂 Projects in this Repository

### 🛡️ [Cyber-Security Anomaly Detection](./cyber_security_eda/)
**Scenario-based synthetic log generation for AI security model evaluation.**
* **Core Logic:** Simulates a **Brute-Force attack** (Status 401) hidden within 2,000+ noisy web server logs.
* **Impact:** Provides "Ground Truth" datasets and specialized **LLM Task Definitions** to benchmark AI reasoning in threat detection.
* **Tech:** `Python`, `JSON` (Automated Reporting), `Seaborn` (Attack Timelines).

### 🌐 [Global Supply Chain Analytics](./supply_chain_analytics/)
**Predictive modeling of delivery delays across 50,000 international shipments.**
* **Core Logic:** Stochastic simulation of port congestion and maritime weather disruptions.
* **Business Impact:** Quantifies **"Total Value at Risk"** to prioritize high-value cargo during bottlenecks.
* **Tech:** `Python 3.14`, `Pandas`, `Seaborn`.

### 💳 [Fintech Fraud Detection Engine](./fintech_fraud_engine/)
**High-fidelity simulation of 100,000 transactions to test anomaly detection patterns.**
* **Core Logic:** Simulates "Impossible Travel" and "Account Takeover" (ATO) scenarios.
* **Impact:** Identifies fraudulent signatures across **~2.4M PLN** of simulated transaction volume.
* **Tech:** `Python`, `NumPy`, `Seaborn`.

### 📦 [Inventory Quality Audit (ICQA) Logic](./inventory_quality_audit/)
**Automated anomaly detection for warehouse logistics, digitizing manual quality workflows.**
* **Core Logic:** Detects negative stock, bin inconsistencies, and "dirty data" patterns.
* **Context:** A Python-based automation of discrepancy identification processes observed during my time at **Amazon**.
* **Tech:** `Python`, `Pandas`.

## 🛠️ Technical Core

* **Languages:** Python 3.14 (Managed via `uv`)
* **Data Tools:** Advanced Pandas (Vectorized operations, Time-series), NumPy.
* **Visualization:** Seaborn & Matplotlib (Heatmaps, Risk Density, Histograms).
* **AI/LLM Benchmarking:** Designing specialized prompt specifications and ground-truth metadata for model evaluation.
* **Focus:** Data Scalability (50k+ records) and Business Intelligence (KPI tracking).

## 💡 Why This Background Matters

As a **Data-Driven Operations Specialist**, I bridge the gap between "warehouse floor reality" and "logical data structures." My background in **Amazon Fulfillment** allows me to design datasets that mimic real-world complexity—ensuring that data pipelines are tested against actual edge cases, not just "happy-path" scenarios.
