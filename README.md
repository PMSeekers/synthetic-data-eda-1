# 🚀 Operations-Driven Data Engineering Portfolio

Welcome! This repository demonstrates my transition from **Amazon Operations** to scalable **Data Engineering** solutions. I build tools inspired by real-world logistical challenges, focusing on synthetic data generation, risk modeling, and audit automation.

## 📂 Projects in this Repository

### 🌐 [Global Supply Chain Analytics](./Global%20Supply%20Chain%20Dashboard/)
**Predictive modeling of delivery delays across 50,000 international shipments.**
* **Core Logic:** Stochastic simulation of port congestion and maritime weather disruptions.
* **Business Impact:** Quantifies **"Total Value at Risk"** to prioritize high-value cargo during bottlenecks.
* **Tech:** `Python 3.14`, `Pandas`, `Seaborn` (Correlation Heatmaps & Statistical Distributions).

### 💳 [Fintech Fraud Detection Engine](./fintech_fraud_engine/)
**High-fidelity simulation of 100,000 transactions to test anomaly detection patterns.**
* **Core Logic:** Simulates "Impossible Travel" and "Account Takeover" (ATO) scenarios.
* **Impact:** Identifies fraudulent signatures across **~2.4M PLN** of simulated transaction volume.
* **Tech:** `Python`, `NumPy`, `Seaborn` (Logarithmic Analysis).

### 📦 [Inventory Quality Audit (ICQA) Logic](./inventory_quality_audit/)
**Automated anomaly detection for warehouse logistics, digitizing manual quality workflows.**
* **Core Logic:** Detects negative stock, bin inconsistencies, and "dirty data" patterns.
* **Context:** A Python-based automation of discrepancy identification processes observed during my time at **Amazon**.
* **Tech:** `Python`, `Pandas`.

## 💡 Why This Background Matters

As a **Data-Driven Operations Specialist**, I bridge the gap between "warehouse floor reality" and "logical data structures." My background in **Amazon Fulfillment** allows me to design datasets that mimic real-world complexity—ensuring that data pipelines are tested against actual edge cases, not just "happy-path" scenarios.
