# 🚀 Synthetic Data Engineering & Quality Audit Portfolio

Welcome! This repository demonstrates a transition from operational excellence at **Amazon ICQA** to scalable **Data Engineering** solutions. I specialize in creating high-fidelity synthetic datasets and automated audit systems designed to benchmark LLMs and data pipelines.

## 📂 Projects in this Repository

### 💳 [Fintech Fraud Detection Engine](./fintech_fraud_engine/)
A high-scale simulation of 100,000 banking transactions designed to test AI's ability to reason through complex fraud patterns.

* **Core Logic:** Simulates "Impossible Travel" and "Account Takeover" (ATO) scenarios.
* **Impact:** Identifies **88.8%** of fraudulent activity, simulating **~2.4M PLN** in blocked risk.
* **Tech:** `Python`, `Pandas`, `Seaborn` (Logarithmic Analysis), `JSON`.

### 📦 [Inventory Quality Audit (ICQA)](./inventory_quality_audit/)
Automated anomaly detection for warehouse logistics, digitizing manual quality control workflows.

* **Core Logic:** Detects negative stock values, logical bin inconsistencies, and "dirty data" patterns.
* **Context:** Direct translation of my 2025-2026 experience at **Amazon** into a scalable Python solution.
* **Tech:** `Python`, `Pandas`.

## 🛠️ Technical Core

* **Languages:** Python 3.x
* **Data Tools:** Advanced Pandas (Vectorized operations, GroupBy, Time-series analysis)
* **Visualization:** Seaborn & Matplotlib for risk density and audit reporting.
* **Focus:** Scalability (100k+ records) and AI-Readiness (JSON exports for LLM training).

## 💡 Business Impact

As a **Synthetic Data Engineer**, I bridge the gap between "raw numbers" and "logical truth." My background in **Inventory Control** allows me to design data environments that mimic real-world complexity, ensuring that AI models are tested against edge cases, not just happy-path data.
