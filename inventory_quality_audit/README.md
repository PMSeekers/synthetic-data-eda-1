Synthetic Data Engineering & Quality Audit
Project Overview
This project demonstrates a practical application of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and data validation techniques. Using Python and Pandas, I developed a script that automates the detection of anomalies in datasets — a skill directly transferred from my experience in Inventory Quality Control (ICQA) at Amazon.

Key Features
Automated Anomaly Detection: Identifies negative stock values and logical inconsistencies.
Missing Data Handling: Automatically detects and rectifies None or missing entries to ensure dataset integrity.
Data Transformation: Cleans and prepares "dirty" synthetic data for further processing or LLM training.
Business Context
While working at Amazon (2025-2026), I was responsible for identifying technical errors in warehouse software. This project translates that "manual" logic into a scalable Python solution, showing how operational experience can be digitized to improve data quality in AI projects.

Tech Stack
Language: Python 3.x
Library: Pandas
Tool: VS Code
How to Run
Ensure you have Python and Pandas installed.
