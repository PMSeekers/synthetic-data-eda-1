# 🌐 Global Supply Chain Analytics & Delay Prediction

### 🎯 Project Overview
This project simulates a global logistics network to identify bottleneck risks and predict delivery delays. It leverages synthetic shipment data to demonstrate how Data Engineering can optimize international trade routes.

---

## 🚀 Key Features
* **🛰️ Predictive Delay Modeling**: Algorithms that calculate "Risk Scores" based on port congestion and transit weather patterns.
* **🗺️ Geospatial Analysis**: Mapping shipping routes from Asia to Europe to identify high-latency hubs.
* **📉 Lead Time Optimization**: Statistical analysis of "Estimated vs Actual" arrival times to improve inventory buffer stocks.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Language**: `Python 3.x`
* **Analysis**: `Pandas`, `NumPy`.
* **Visualization**: `Plotly` or `Folium` (for interactive maps).
