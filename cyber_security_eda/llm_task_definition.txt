
### LLM EVALUATION TASK DEFINITION
Project: Synthetic Security Log Analysis

Objective: 
Evaluate the model's ability to identify a low-and-slow brute force attack within a noisy web server log.

Expected Model Output:
1. Identify the suspicious IP address.
2. Characterize the attack type (Brute-Force / Unauthorized Access attempt).
3. Determine the peak time of the attack based on request frequency.

Ground Truth (Context for Evaluator):
- Attacker IP: 10.0.0.66
- Attack Window: Starts 30 minutes after initial log entry.
- Key Indicator: 50 consecutive 401 status codes in a short timeframe.
